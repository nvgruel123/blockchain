### Properties of a HASH function H :

- H can be applied to a block of data at any size
- H produces a fixed length output
- H(x) is easy to compute for any given x.
- For any given block x, it is computationally infeasible to find x such that H(x) = h
- For any given block x, it is computationally infeasible to find with H(y) = H(x).
- It is computationally  infeasible to find any pair (x, y) such that H(x) = H(y)
