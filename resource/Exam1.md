### Properties of a HASH function H :

#### 1.H can be applied to a block of data at any size
#### 2.H produces a fixed length output
#### 3.H(x) is easy to compute for any given x.
#### 4.For any given block x, it is computationally infeasible to find x such that H(x) = h
#### 5.For any given block x, it is computationally infeasible to find with H(y) = H(x).
#### 6.It is computationally  infeasible to find any pair (x, y) such that H(x) = H(y)
